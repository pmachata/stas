* v2
- how often counter baseline is updated:
  - once a second (for measuring throughput: pps, kbps)
  - once at start (gauge measuring relative change: p, kb since tool start)
  - never (absolute gauge: p, kb indicated by the counter)

- units
  - ip-link and similar counters have standard meaning, and th.sh should
    know what unit to use. That is not the case for ethtool counters
    though, where th.sh should allow specifying in a config file what unit
    each of the counters is. E.g.:

    : *_octets_* = B
    : *_pause_duration_* = us/s

    These units could then be used to figure out how to display the
    counter, and if it should be absolute or relative.


- different types of counters
  - ethtool
  - ip link
  - tc ingress, egress

- grouping
  - allow selecting several interfaces in one go
  - allow selecting several counters in one go
    - allow wild cards as well
  - e.g. (eth0, eth1) a_frames_transmitted_ok

- aggregated stats
  - average of several counters, sum of several counters, divide one
    counter by another (to get avg. packet size)
  - average and variance over time

- top talkers
  - show the counters that change, sorted by how much they change

- config file
